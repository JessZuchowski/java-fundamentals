## Lab 01
Three feature tasks: 
1. Pluralize: Write a function called pluralize that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an "s" if the number is 0 or >1.
  Task complete in: 1.5 hours.
2. Flipping Coins: Write a function called flipNHeads that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0-1, numbers >0.5 are tails, numbers >= 0.5 are heads. Print out heads or tails on one line for each flip. Print "It took FLIPS flips to flip N heads in a row." once n heads have been flipped in a row.
