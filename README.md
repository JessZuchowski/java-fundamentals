Three feature tasks: 
1. Pluralize: Write a function called pluralize that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an "s" if the number is 0 or >1.
  Task complete in: 1.5 hours.
2. Flipping Coins: Write a function called flipNHeads that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0-1, numbers >0.5 are tails, numbers >= 0.5 are heads. Print out heads or tails on one line for each flip. Print "It took FLIPS flips to flip N heads in a row." once n heads have been flipped in a row.

## Lab 03
Three feature tasks:
1. Analyzing Weather Data: Use data provided, iterate through all data to find the min and max values. Use HashSet of type Integer to keep track of all the unique temperatures seen. Iterate from min to max temp and print any temps not seen. 
  Task complete in: 1 hour, minus writing test code.
2. Tallying Election: Write a function called tally that accepts a List of Strings representing votes and returns one string to show what got the most votes.
